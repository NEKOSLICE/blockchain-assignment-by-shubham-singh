# Assignment 5: IPFS Privacy and Encryption

This assignment demonstrates how to use the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** along with **OpenSSL** to perform file encryption and ensure privacy for the uploaded content.

---
# Steps
# 1. Create a file to be added to IPFS
```

echo "Hello, IPFS!" > myfile.txt
```
<br>

# 2.Add the original file to IPFS
```

ipfs add myfile.txt
```
# 3.Encrypt the file using OpenSSL (AES-256-CBC)
```

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -salt -in myfile.txt -out myfile_encrypted.txt -pass pass:yourpassword
```
# 4.Add the encrypted file to IPFS
```

ipfs add myfile_encrypted.txt
```
# 5.View the encrypted file (optional)
```

cat myfile_encrypted.txt
```
# 6.Decrypt the file
```

openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -in myfile_encrypted.txt -out decrypted_file.txt -pass pass:yourpassword
```
# 7.Verify the decrypted file content
```

cat decrypted_file.txt
```
# 8.Add the decrypted file to IPFS
```

ipfs add decrypted_file.txt
```

 # Notes
‚óè Replace `yourpassword` with a strong, secure password of your choice.
<br>
‚óè Ensure that IPFS is properly installed and initialized before running these commands.
# Blockchain Practical - MetaMask Wallet & Sepolia Testnet

This repo contains my blockchain practical work for creating a MetaMask wallet, receiving Sepolia test ETH, and making a transaction on the Sepolia testnet.

---

## üîê MetaMask Wallet Creation (Sepolia Testnet)

### Introduction
In this practical, I created a MetaMask wallet and performed a transaction using the Sepolia testnet. This includes setting up MetaMask, connecting to Sepolia, claiming test ETH from the faucet, and sending a transaction.

---

## ‚úÖ Transaction Details

- **Network:** Sepolia Testnet  
- **Amount Sent:** 0.01 ETH  
- **Transaction Hash:**  
`0xa64bf5b7ddcd28172e6f536a78806045c60b25489057507aaa7268527de8afc3` 
[üîó View on Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xa64bf5b7ddcd28172e6f536a78806045c60b25489057507aaa7268527de8afc3)  
- **Status:** Successful ‚úÖ

---
## üí∏ Getting Sepolia ETH from Faucet

1. Opened the Sepolia Faucet hosted on Google Cloud.
2. Logged in using my Google account.
3. Copied and pasted my MetaMask wallet address into the input field.
4. Clicked on **"Request 0.05 ETH"**.
5. ETH was successfully sent to my wallet in a few seconds.
6. Verified the deposit by checking on Sepolia Etherscan.

### üì∏ Screenshot:

---

## üîÅ Steps Followed for the Transaction

1. Installed MetaMask extension on my browser.
2. Created a new wallet and backed up the Secret Recovery Phrase.
3. Connected MetaMask to **Sepolia Testnet** (added custom network manually).
4. Claimed **test ETH** from the faucet.
5. Sent **0.03 ETH** to another wallet address using MetaMask.
6. Verified transaction success on Sepolia Etherscan.
